# Aurora M4 Graphics Implementation Roadmap

Status: **Canonical implementation plan**
Version: **0.1**

This roadmap orders M4 work by hard dependencies. A checkbox in the global roadmap is completed only after the relevant implementation and runtime gate are satisfied.

## Phase G0 — Contracts

Status: **Complete (architecture only)**

- define graphics component ownership;
- define Display Service contract;
- define surface/buffer atomic commit model;
- define compositor responsibilities;
- define normalized graphical input routing;
- define window-management protocol;
- define Desktop Shell boundary;
- define Identity pre-session integration.

No runtime claim is implied.

## Phase G1 — Display foundation

Status: **Complete**

Implemented:

- [x] output object with bounded mode table and validated pixel geometry;
- [x] boot-framebuffer display backend adapter;
- [x] output and mode/geometry discovery registry with boot validation probe;
- [x] compositor-owned heap backbuffer with checked size/lifecycle;
- [x] safe bounded present operation for the boot-framebuffer backend;
- [x] monotonic presentation serials and explicit buffer-release signaling.

Foundation item set: **implemented**.

Acceptance gate: **runtime verified in QEMU**.

A Ring 3 graphics service repeatedly presents validated test frames through the capability-gated display contract without direct client framebuffer access. The validation path requires two monotonically increasing presentation serials and verifies synchronous release state.

## Phase G2 — Surface/buffer core

Status: **Complete**

Implemented:

- [x] bounded graphics-buffer object backed by refcounted shared memory;
- [x] capability-backed surface objects with explicit rights;
- [x] attach + bounded damage + atomic pending-to-committed publication.

Remaining:

- [x] capability-aware buffer lifetime, deferred destroy and safe object reuse;
- [x] bounded frame-callback core tied to commit/presentation serials;
- [x] capability-gated Ring 3 graphics-buffer map/unmap syscall path;
- [x] strict 32-bit RGB mask, stride, size and backing metadata validation;
- [x] Ring 3 frame-callback request/delivery ABI.

Acceptance gate:

Two isolated Ring 3 clients can independently submit surfaces; neither can map or corrupt the other's buffer.

Acceptance probe: **runtime verified in QEMU**. Two isolated Ring 3 clients now execute buffer map/unmap, surface attach/damage/commit and frame-callback request/delivery through the real SYSCALL/SYSRET path; cross-client handle attempts cannot map or attach the other client's buffer.

Audit closure:

- [x] capability-aware surface lifetime, destruction and slot recycling;
- [x] explicit cancellation/cleanup semantics for pending and queued frame callbacks when a surface is destroyed.

G2 acceptance gate and lifecycle hardening are runtime verified in QEMU.

## Phase G3 — Software compositor

Status: **Complete**

Implemented and runtime verified:

- [x] bounded capability-backed scene graph;
- [x] deterministic z-order;
- [x] output clipping with checked pixel addressing;
- [x] 32-bit packed RGB/RGBA CPU alpha composition;
- [x] translated surface damage aggregation;
- [x] persistent CPU backbuffer composition;
- [x] damage-driven output presentation;
- [x] frame-callback completion after successful presentation;
- [x] moving/overlapping surface QEMU correctness probe.

Implemented and runtime verified in the second/third G3 blocks:

- [x] bounded full-surface occlusion culling for fully covered opaque nodes;
- [x] nearest-neighbor integer scaling (1x-4x) with 0/90/180/270 transforms;
- [x] DISPLAY|CONTROL-gated privileged surface classes and secure-scene exclusion rules;
- [x] RGB10A2 composition into the SDR backbuffer;
- [x] 48-bit RGB12 composition into the SDR backbuffer;
- [x] RGBA16F decoding with fixed-point gamut/transfer handling and baseline HDR-to-SDR tone mapping.

Acceptance gate:

Multiple moving/overlapping surfaces render correctly in QEMU with bounded memory growth and deterministic clipping tests.

Current gate status: **G3 runtime verified in QEMU**. Moving/overlapping surfaces, clipping, alpha, damage, occlusion, transforms/scaling, secure-scene exclusion and RGB10A2/RGB12/RGBA16F composition all pass the mandatory boot validation gate.

Color accuracy note: the current HDR-to-SDR path is a bounded integer/fixed-point baseline intended for compositor correctness and safe fallback. Production mastering-grade transfer functions, calibration and perceptual tone mapping remain performance/color-management hardening work rather than a G3 correctness blocker.

## Phase G4 — Pointer and modern input

Implement:

- mouse/pointer device path;
- normalized device-independent events;
- compositor hit testing;
- pointer focus;
- keyboard focus routing;
- focus/capture revocation;
- USB HID input foundation where transport dependencies are ready.

Acceptance gate:

Mouse and keyboard interact with multiple surfaces without cross-client event leakage.

## Phase G5 — Window protocol and Shell

Implement:

- toplevel configure/ack;
- activation tokens;
- placement/stacking policy;
- decorations;
- Desktop Shell process;
- launcher/panel/task switching baseline.

Acceptance gate:

A user can launch/switch/move/resize/close multiple native test windows through Shell policy rather than direct compositor privilege.

## Phase G6 — Identity migration

Implement:

- pre-session host;
- compositor-backed Aurora Identity System App;
- secure transition to authenticated session;
- lock/unlock presentation;
- compositor/Shell failure fallback to framebuffer recovery.

Acceptance gate:

Cold boot can authenticate through the normal compositor UI, enter a user desktop only after session readiness, lock/unlock safely, and still reach recovery login when the normal graphics stack is intentionally disabled.

## Phase G7 — Activity Spaces and persistence

Implement:

- Activity Space object model;
- Shell mapping of windows to spaces;
- persistent reconstructible workspace metadata;
- restore intents;
- customization framework.

Acceptance gate:

A reboot can restore Activity Space organization without granting stale process/surface capabilities.

## Phase G8 — Performance hardening

Measure and improve:

- frame latency;
- CPU time per damaged area;
- memory bandwidth/copies;
- idle wakeups;
- buffer count/memory;
- input-to-present latency.

Later acceleration may add GPU-backed rendering without replacing the client protocol.


## Extended color / HDR / output capability foundation

Status: **In progress**

Implemented foundation:

- [x] color primaries, transfer function, range and HDR static metadata are first-class buffer/mode metadata;
- [x] canonical 8-bit packed RGB/RGBA, RGB10A2, RGB12 and RGBA16F formats are validated;
- [x] output capabilities expose SDR/HDR/PQ/HLG/wide-gamut/VRR/DSC flags, bit-depth limits and VRR range.

- [x] DDC / E-DDC transport abstraction with bounded EDID block reads;
- [x] DisplayPort/eDP AUX-DPCD base link capability path;
- [x] HDMI digital sink capability path through EDID/CTA;

- [x] PCI display-class GPU driver registry with match/bind lifecycle;
- [x] QEMU Standard VGA / Bochs VBE native driver foundation;
- [x] runtime PCI display-class probe + BAR0 LFB validation;
- [x] native GPU candidate attachment with boot-framebuffer fallback preserved;
- [ ] vendor GPU scanout/color-pipeline programming;
- [x] baseline compositor color conversion and fixed-point HDR-to-SDR tone mapping.
